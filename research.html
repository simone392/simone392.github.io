                                                This framework was created by combining two frameworks from physics and math education. The goal of it is to create a tool for myself, and the broader Physics Education Research (PER) community, to study what we have coined “physics identity” or the ability to identify as a physicist/physics person, that considers the intersections of race. The CPI framework combines two existing identity models:  one for “Physics Identity” that consists of constructs that mark important aspects of identity for physicists, and one that is for “Racialized Identity” that consists of broad institutional and structural resources that can be available (or not) for students of different backgrounds. When used together in the CPI framework, these constructs and resources elucidate important differences in experiences for physicists of color, compared to physicists from hegemonic backgrounds.

                                This project is focused on how to bridge the theory we have developed with practice, specifically in the form of informal STEAM educational programming. In the literature, there are many links between racial identity and performance art.  This work explores how these links can provide a useful avenue to cultivate physics identities amongst students of color. This project uses the themes from the Black physicist study, and knowledge about the power of identity exploration in performance art, to build programs that have a goal of cultivating and nurturing black physicists identities.

                                        The bulk of the workshop facilitation work I have done is for a student organization at CU Boulder called <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/colorado.edu/cu-prime/">CU-Prime</a>. The organization has a mission to create an equitable community within the CU Physics Department. The organizing circle of the group regularly holds diversity workshops in order to self educate and train it members about different forms of oppression and privilege. In addition, in collaboration with Wagma Mommandi, I have facilitated two workshops for students of color in STEM about the researched experiences of people of color in the sciences.<br> <br>
