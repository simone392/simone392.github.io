                                This framework was created by combining two frameworks from physics and math education [1][2]. The goal of it is to create a tool for myself, and the broader Physics Education Research (PER) community, to study what we have coined “physics identity” or the ability to identify as a physicist/physics person, that considers the intersections of race. The well known framework in PER for physics identity [1] is built off a broader framework for science identity that was developed through a study of women of color in STEM (none of whom were physicists), and does not explicitly include constructs that highlight structural and institutional factors that impact a person along their career. In an attempt to add in this nuance, I have used this framework in conjunction with the Racialized Identity resources framework [2] that includes more broad institutional and structural resource categories that can be available (or not) for physicists of different backgrounds.

                                                This project is focused on how to bridge the theory we have developed with practice, specifically in the form of informal STEAM educational programming. In the literature, there are many links between racial identity and performance art.  This work explores how these links can provide a useful avenue to cultivate physics identities amongst students of color. This project uses the themes from the Black physicist study, and knowledge about the power of identity exploration in performance art, to build programs that have a goal of cultivating and nurturing black physicists identities.
