                                        PISEC is an informal science education program that partners with organizations and K-12 schools in the broader Boulder area to create educational spaces to learn physics.The longest running program in PISEC, the after school program, provides opportunities for university students (undergraduates, graduate students, and post docs) to teach inquiry-based science activities to K-12 populations that are underrepresented in science. PISEC partnered with the Montbello Campus to pilot a STEAM site. Students learned about electricity & magnetism and electronics, built their own electrostatic paddles, and created a video with them. <br>

                                This project is focused on how to bridge the theory we have developed with practice, specifically in the form of informal STEAM educational programming. In the literature, there are many links between racial identity and performance art.  This work explores how these links can provide a useful avenue to cultivate physics identities amongst students of color. This project uses the themes from the Black physicist study, and knowledge about the power of identity exploration in performance art, to build programs that have a goal of cultivating and nurturing black physicists identities.

                                        The bulk of the workshop facilitation work I have done is for a student organization at CU Boulder called <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/colorado.edu/cu-prime/">CU-Prime</a>. The organization has a mission to create an equitable community within the CU Physics Department. The organizing circle of the group regularly holds diversity workshops in order to self educate and train it members about different forms of oppression and privilege. In addition, in collaboration with Wagma Mommandi, I have facilitated two workshops for students of color in STEM about the researched experiences of people of color in the sciences.<br> <br>
